***You can view the paper and the presentation of the project***

## 1. Introduction
In this project we tried to see if we can identify toxic comments and insult by using Machine Learning  algorithms.
We implemented Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVC and AdaBoost algorithms. We also examined the effects of word2vec based text augmentation.





## 2. How to Run?
Just make sure everything on the requirements.txt is installed. Then you can run main.ipynb. You can try out
different classifiers by extending scripts/classification/_Classifier. Just make sure fit() and predict() functions
are correctly implemented.


## 3. Blogs
We documented our progress under the publication of [bbm406f19](https://medium.com/bbm406f19) on medium. You can read them to see our thinking processes. Don't forget to give claps :innocent:

## 4.Dataset
We decided to use Wikipedia comments that was used in [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data). Dataset has the following labels:

- toxic

- severe_toxic

- obscene

- threat

- insult

- identity_hate
